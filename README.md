# iTunesRPC
A WIP Discord Rich Presence App for iTunes on Windows or Music on macOS

With iTunesRPC you can display your current listening status in Discord, just as Spotify does!

# So why this if there are already alternatives
I couldn't find an alternative that can display the cover art of local files (non-AppleMusic tracks).

This only really makes sense for you if you, like me, want an RPC Client that can display all album artworks (even on local files).

# Work-In-Progress
This is very WIP, it should not yet be considered a finished product

# Planned Features
- Cover Art (even on local files) (need upload solution)
- Timestamp of current playing track
- Basic track info
- Cros-Platform? (Now Supports macOS and Windows)
- Many more?

# Usage
Just download the jar (future if there are any releases) or build it yourself.
File uploading needs a solution (not usable, currently on private host)

# Required files
All required files will now be extracted from the JAR file automatically.

~~All of these files will later be included in the jar and auto extract or somthing like this.
They are all in the root of this repository and need to be at the working directory of the porgram.~~
- ~~discord_game_sdk.dll (Discord Game SDK)~~
- ~~getTrackInfo.vbs (Get track info from iTunes)~~
- ~~extractArtwork.vbs (Extract the Artwork from iTunes)~~
